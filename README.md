# cookies.txt

A chrome extension that exports your cookies into the Netscape cookie format accepted by tools like `curl` and `youtube-dl`.

# Usage

# Build

# Deploy

# Notes

Browser extensions are inherently a security risk.  I'd recommend not using any Chrome extension that handles cookies and instead run this source code locally.  This is why I've published this as an Open Source alternative to other popular existing Chrome Extensions.
